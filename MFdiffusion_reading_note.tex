\section{\texttt{Main\_models\_1\_3.m}}\label{main_models_1_3}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Main Matlab file: \texttt{"GMMDiffusion/Main\_models\_1\_3"} for model without $\lambda$ (endorsement effects) and \texttt{"GMMDiffusion/Main\_models\_2\_4"} for model with $\lambda$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 0}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 26: 2 model types: modelType == 1 for $q_N = q_P$ and == 3 for $q_N \ne q_P$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 29: Picking 43 BSS villages
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 33: Different versions of moments
    (In the paper, they say they use 6 moments, but no version says 6 moments, why?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 49: \texttt{TMonths}: number of months in data of each village
\end{itemize} since every element of a matrix is contained in the array slice defined by dimensions 1 and 2.

\subsection*{Part 4}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 63-69: Parameter grids: although explained in detail in the Supplementary Materials, not shown how they did it. (Grid values differ from the supplementary material.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 5}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 90: Load the network data, which contains adjacency matrices of 43 villages
  \item 91: What and why do they do this here? (Element-wise X*X?) (Sorry for a silly questions.)
  \item 95-: For each village,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 101: Load the leader data: ID and dummy of being a leader or not
      \item 106: Load the take-up data: Only dummy (maybe the same order as the one above?)
      \item 107: \texttt{EmpRate} is the proportion of non-leaders who took up MF
      \item 110: \texttt{inGiant} is a connected component of a network that contains a finite fraction of the entire nodes. (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_component}{Wiki}; This may be \href{https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/social-media/0/steps/16048}{a better reference.}) So, I think this is like the fraction of sampled nodes in a giant component. It's not clear how 'giant' is defined. Maybe the biggest cluster in the village?
      \item 113-114: \texttt{d} = degree of network, \texttt{hermits} = households without any connections with other households, which is assigned 1 if the column sum from the adjacency matrix is 0 (This is \texttt{d}). (i.e. no connection).
      \item 117: Load the covariates of the households (not sure which column corresponds to which variable, maybe in readme file or somewhere?) The Read Me file has a list of covariates on P1, I guess the variables are stores in the same order of variables listed in the Read Me file?
      \item 120: Select covariates to use (but in the end they used all the covariates in the data?) It seems that they use all 6 of them that are included in the data set.
      \item 123-130: Restrict the sample to households belonging to the giant networks?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 123: Leaders
          \item 124: Take-up
          \item 125: Covariates
          \item 127: Take-up by leaders
          \item 128: Covariates of leaders
          \item 129: Outcome = Take-up by leaders
          \item 130: Covars = Covariates of leaders
            \begin{itemize}
              \item \texttt{Outcome} and \texttt{Covars} will be used to estimate $\beta$
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
      \item 133-137: Second neighbors (\texttt{sec}) = matrix indicating households whose distance between them is 2.
        Here, $X^2$ means $X * X$.
        (See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix#Matrix_powers}{here})
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 134-136: Ruling out households themselves (with two steps, they can always come back to themselves)
          \item 137: Ruling out households with distance 1 (think about a triangle)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 6}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 142-143: Logistic regression by using leaders to estimate $\beta$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 7}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 147-160: Calculate the moments in the case where $q_N = q_P$
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 153-160: Calculate moments at each grid of $q_N (= q_P)$
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 156: Call the function \hyperref[divergence_model]{\texttt{divergence\_model}} which calculates moments
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item 163-178: Calculate moments in the case where $q_N \ne q_P$
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 169-174: Calculate moments at each grid of $(q_N, q_P)$
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 172: Call the function \hyperref[divergence_model]{\texttt{divergence\_model}} which calculates moments
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Note: In the calculations here, a matrix $D$ is obtained.
    This is a length($q_N$ grids)-by-length($q_P$ grids) matrix, and each element is a (\# villages)-by-(\# moments) matrix.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part 8}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 188-194: Select if just obtaining point estimates or standard errors through bootstrap
    \begin{itemize}
      \item bootstrap == 0: point estimates
      \item bootstrap == 1: standard errors through bootstrap (1000 times)
    \end{itemize}
  \item 197-207: Select if two step optimal weights are used or not
    \begin{itemize}
      \item twoStepOptimal == 1: 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 202: With some guess of $q_N (= 0.09)$ and $q_P (= 0.45)$, obtain moments by the function \texttt{divergence\_model}
          \item 203: Calculate the outer product of the moments, divided by the number of villages
          \item 204: Take the inverse of the above expression, which will be the weight in the second step
          \item \textbf{Note}: I guess usually people 
            (i)solve the GMM problem with an identity matrix as a weight to get the consistent estimate of parameters, and 
            (ii) get the weight in the way described above.
            Here, somehow authors set $q_N$ and $q_P$ and calculate the weight based on these parameters.
            If these are not derived by consistent estimates, then the weight is inconsistent and thus the estimates in the second step will be biased as well.
        \end{itemize}
      \item twoStepOptimal == 0: use an identity matrix as the weight in the ``second'' step
    \end{itemize}
  \item 211-216: Obtain a new 4-dimension (length($q_N$ grids)-by-length($q_P$ grids)-by-(\# villages)-by-(\# moments))   $Dnew$ from a nested matrix $D$
  \item 223-259: Bootstrap (note: here in the bootstrap, randomly generated village weights are used, not that villages are randomly chosen with replacement)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 226-231: Generate bootstrap weights 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item bootstrap == 0 (ie. for point estimate): same weights for all villages
          \item bootstrap == 1 (ie. for bootstrap standard errors): randomly generated weights follow exponential distribution (normalized so that the sum of weights is $1$)
        \end{itemize}
      \item 236-244: Calculate the criterion function for each ($q_N, q_P$) grid
        \begin{itemize}
          \item 240: Calculate weighted moments 
          \item 242: Calculate the criterion function
        \end{itemize}
      \item 246-254: Derive the parameter values that minimize the objective function and store the results
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{\texttt{Main\_models\_2\_4.m}}\label{main_models_2_4}

The same structure as \texttt{Main\_models\_1\_3.m}, but with $\lambda$ (endorsement effect). 

\begin{itemize}
	\item 66: The grid for $\lambda$ is determined. 
	\item 68-73: The grid for $q_P, q_N$ are set here. What's the logic behind changing these grid based on whether to have $\lambda$?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Main part}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3: Declare a variable ``netstats'' which contains information of networks in each village (for the function \texttt{persistent}, see \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/persistent.html}{here})
  \item 7-49: If a variable ``netstats'' is already defined, then almost skip the parts, but if not yet, then calculate each statistics of the networks (7-43)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 8: Use a function \hyperref[breadthdistRAL]{\texttt{breadthdistRAL}} to calculate a matrix of R and D. R is ??. D is the distance between each leader and household which is calculated with a function, \texttt{breadth.m}: 
      	\begin{itemize}
      		\item I think this function calculates the distance between everyone in the data set. Not too sure.
      		\item 19: Detect the size of each row in the connection/adjacency matrix (CIJ) which is really \texttt{X}.

              \item 58-59: If there is any household who are linked with other households (netstats(j).degree $>$ 0) but has no infected neighbors (infected Neighbors == 0), 
                calculate the fraction $\frac{\text{\# HH who are linked with other households, don't have any infected neighbors, but are infected themselves}}{\text{\# HH who are linked with other households and don't have any infected neighbors}}$
              \item 60-61: If there is no such household in the village, then just let the moment be $0$ (since the denominator of the above fraction will be $0$ in this case)
            \end{itemize}
          \item 64-69: ``Fraction of individuals that are infected in the neighborhood of infected leaders stats(1) = 0'' (moment (3) in the paper)

            \begin{itemize}
              \item If \texttt{sum(netstats(j).neighborOfNonInfected) $>$ 0} (???), calculate the fraction (???)

          \item 110-112: ``Covariance of individuals taking with share of second neighbors taking'' (moment (6) in the paper)
      \item 115-141: Case3 (moments (2), (5), and (6) in the paper, same as case 2, but purged of leader injection points):
